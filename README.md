The Goal of this project is to predict how likely a customer is going to default, using historical customer data, This project can be identified as binary classification problem, which was solved using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

**Introduction**

Customer loan defaults refer to the failure of a borrower to repay a loan according to the agreed-upon terms. This can happen for a variety of reasons such as a change in financial circumstances. Loan defaults can have significant consequences for both the borrower and the lender. Understanding the causes of loan defaults and developing strategies to minimize them is a crucial aspect of responsible lending and credit risk management.

In this project as mentioned, machine learning techniques were leveraged to predict the likelihood of customer defaulting. By training this Machine learning models on historical data, lender can identify patterns and trends that are associated with higher risk default such as specific demographic characteristics or financial behaviors.
